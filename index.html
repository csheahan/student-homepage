          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm currently a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My interests in computer science vary greatly, ranging from security to software engineering to theory. I also love tinkering around with new technologies, whether it be hardware, a paradigm, or even a joke language such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_%28programming_language%29">whitespace</a>. It is this constant stream of new that makes things fun and fresh.</p>
          <p>I started programming in middle school. I learned that the TI-83 calculators we used in math were programmable, and it provided a fun and new way of passing time in class. I still remember my first program, infinitely printing out the phrase "Hello" and watching it print seemingly infinitely on the screen. This programming on calculators consisted mainly of text programs which were mostly jokes, until I took my first programming class second year of high school. Over the next 3 years, I would learn programming with Java, take the AP test, compete in competitive computer science via state UIL competitions, and participate in Robotics. It was after all of this that I knew computer science was for me. For what i've done in college, click <a href="#School" onclick="schoolClick()">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy quite a few things. Having participated in Football (2 years varsity, both years made quarter-finals in state), Basketball, and Track (100M, 200M, 400M, and shotput throughout my career), I have a great appreciation for most if not all sports. When I have the free time, I love to keep active and enjoy taking on physical challenges. Along with sports, I have also found the human mind fascinating and love reading about psychology. Other than the mind and body, I just like to keep an open mind and try to constantly try something new.</p>

          <h4>HighLow-NES</h4>
          <p>A simple card game coded in 6502 Assembly for the NES. The card game follows a simple mechanic: you flip over your first card, you guess if the next one will be higher or lower, and flip. Keep track of high scores and current streaks.

          <h4>UTCS Windows 8 Companion App</h4>
          <p>A Windows 8 app made during a 24 hour hackathon (<a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hacktx/">HackTX</a>) with Matthew Rayermann(<a href="https://github.com/rolledback">Github</a>/<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-rayermann/59/191/bab?trk=tbr">LinkedIn</a>) and Jon Lee(<a href="https://github.com/chenclee">Github</a>/<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-lee/66/241/788">LinkedIn</a>). We got the idea from an old app that existed before our new Computer Science building. We decided to make a Windows 8 metro app because none of us had any prior experience in C# or Windows 8 dev, so where better than a hackathon to learn such a skill. The backend comprised of completely perl code running commands on the CS machines which was then grabbed to the app to be parsed and displayed. In the end, we were able to show which machines were up, had someone physically in front of them, were down, how many users were logged in, the load averages, which printers were up, how many items were in the printer queues, and how many bits those items combined took up. Some features we wanted to add but weren't able to due to infamiliarity with Windows 8/time constraints were graphs, an auto ssh in button, and a button to ssh into a machine with the lowest users and load average. In the end, we won honorable mention from Microsoft. For more information, check out the <a href="https://github.com/rolledback/UTCS_Companion_HackTX">Github page</a>.</p>
