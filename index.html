          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I'm currently a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My interests in the field include security, software engineeing, the theory behind Computer Science and algorithms, and anything else that catches my fancy such as computational linguistics.</p>
          <p>I started programming as a humble middle schooler fiddling around on my TI-83, passing the time in math class. After making my first program infinitely print out the phrase "Hello", my curiosity for Computer Science started. Once I got into high school, however, my experience evolved as I began taking Computer Science for the next 3 years. I learned how to code in Java, took the AP test, competed in competitive comding via state UIL competition, and participated in FIRST robotics. For what I've done in college, check out my <a onclick="schoolClick()" href="#School">school work</a> and my <a onclick="sideProjectsClick()" href="#SideProjects">side projects</a>.</p>
          <p>Outside of Computer Science I enjoy quite a few things. Having participated in Football (2 years varsity, both years made quarter-finals in state), Track and Field (100M, 200M, 400M, and varsity shotput throughout my career), and Basketball, I have a great appreciation for most if not all sports. I always love physical challenges, whether they be through weight lifting, calisthenics, or any other form. Along with sports, I also find the human mind fascinating and love reading psychology occasionally. A third hobby of mine is lockpicking, opening anything from handcuffs to deadbolts. Other than those hobbies, I love keeping an open mind and trying new things.</p>

            <li>
              Went over topics such as:
              <ul>
                <li>Stable Marriage, Graph Problems and Traversals, Greedy Algorithms, and Divide and Conquer Algorithms</li>
                <li>Dynamic Programming, Max-flow Min-cut problems, and the Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm</li>
                <li>NP, NP-completeness, PSPACE, PSPACE-completeness, Undecidability, the Halting Problem</li>
                <li>Approximation Algorithms and Randomized Algorithms</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Used techniques, discrete math, and proofs to implement and design algorithms to solve the same problem, the optimization of an auction (creating a Maximum Weight Maximum Cardinality Matching of a bipartite graph), in increasingly faster times. We started with the naive solution of O(n!), brought it down to O(n^2) through simple observations, and finally ended up at a runtime of O(n) taking a psuedo-dynamic approach.</li>
            <li>Modified the above problem into computing a suitable selling price for each auction taking a second price approach where the second highest bid sets the selling price for the highest bidder. We first implemented this in O(n^2) time. We then took advantage of certain observations and created a new algorithm that ran in O(n) time.</li>

          <h4>HighLow-NES</h4>
          <p>A simple card game coded in 6502 Assembly for the NES. The card game follows a simple mechanic: you flip over your first card, you guess if the next one will be higher or lower, and flip. Keep track of high scores and current streaks. For more information on the game, learning to code NES games, or the game itself, check out the <a href="https://github.com/csheahan/HighLow-NES">Github page</a>.</p>
          <h4>UTCS Windows 8 Companion App</h4>
          <p>A Windows 8 app made during a 24 hour hackathon (<a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hacktx/">HackTX</a>) with Matthew Rayermann(<a href="https://github.com/rolledback">Github</a>/<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-rayermann/59/191/bab?trk=tbr">LinkedIn</a>) and Jon Lee(<a href="https://github.com/chenclee">Github</a>/<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-lee/66/241/788">LinkedIn</a>). We got the idea from an old app that existed before our new Computer Science building. We decided to make a Windows 8 metro app because none of us had any prior experience in C# or Windows 8 dev, so where better than a hackathon to learn such a skill. The backend comprised of completely perl code running commands on the CS machines which was then grabbed to the app to be parsed and displayed. In the end, we were able to show which machines were up, had someone physically in front of them, were down, how many users were logged in, the load averages, which printers were up, how many items were in the printer queues, and how many bits those items combined took up. Some features we wanted to add but weren't able to due to infamiliarity with Windows 8/time constraints were graphs, an auto ssh in button, and a button to ssh into a machine with the lowest users and load average. In the end, we won honorable mention from Microsoft. For more information, check out the <a href="https://github.com/rolledback/UTCS_Companion_HackTX">Github page</a>.</p>
