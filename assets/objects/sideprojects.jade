      Description: "HighLow-NES is a simple NES game written in 8-bit 6502 assembly and meant to be run via a NES emulator or, if flashed to a cart, NES hardware. High Low is a card game in which a player flips over a card, then guesses if the next card will be higher or lower in value. The objective is to achieve the highest streak of successful guesses. This project started in the summer 2013 because I was inspired after playing a homebrew NES game, Battle Kid: Fortress of Peril. I wondered how it was made, and decided to make one myself. For more information on the game or to check out the source code, head to the <a href=\"https://github.com/csheahan/HighLow-NES\">Github page</a>."

      Description: "A Windows 8 app made during a 24 hour hackathon (<a href=\"https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/hacktx/\">HackTX</a>) with Matthew Rayermann(<a href=\"https://github.com/rolledback\">Github</a>/<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-rayermann/59/191/bab?trk=tbr\">LinkedIn</a>) and Jon Lee(<a href=\"https://github.com/chenclee\">Github</a>/<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jonathan-lee/66/241/788\">LinkedIn</a>). We got the idea from an old app that existed before our new Computer Science building. We decided to make a Windows 8 metro app because none of us had any prior experience in C# or Windows 8 dev, so where better than a hackathon to learn such a skill. The backend comprised of completely perl code running commands on the CS machines which was then scraped by the app to be parsed and displayed. In the end, we were able to show which machines were up, had someone physically in front of them, were down, how many users were logged in, the load averages, which printers were up, how many items were in the printer queues, and how many bits those items combined took up. Some features we wanted to add but weren't able to due to infamiliarity with Windows 8/time constraints were graphs, an auto ssh in button, and a button to ssh into a machine with the lowest users and load average. In the end, we won honorable mention from Microsoft. For more information, check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/rolledback/UTCS_Companion_HackTX\">Github page</a>."
